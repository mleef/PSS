# Probe Set Search
Probe Set Search is a web app for analyzing Affymetrix chip design specific coverage of custom sequences.

Probe Set Search allows users to:

1. Identify design specific probe sets with the best coverage of the given sequence ![alt text](https://github.com/mleef/PSS/tree/master/web/images/i.png "Search Page")
2. View both exon and gene level probe coverage ![alt text](https://github.com/mleef/PSS/tree/master/web/images/gv.png "Gene Level View")
3. Create custom probe sets out of highest quality probes and download them in .spf format ![alt text](https://github.com/mleef/PSS/tree/master/web/images/nps.png "Add to custom probe set")
4. Filter probes visually by setting cross hybridization score thresholds ![alt text](https://github.com/mleef/PSS/tree/master/web/images/cv.png "Histogram Coverage Viewer")
